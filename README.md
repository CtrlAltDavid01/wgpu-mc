#### Intro

`wgpu` is a crate implementing the WebGPU specification in Rust. It's primary backends are Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.


#### Goals

wgpu-mc is a standalone rendering engine for Minecraft-compatible projects. It's also a
replacement to Blaze3D using Fabric and the JNI to interface the two. 

#### Current status

The project is currently under active development. Quite a few important features have been implemented,
but not all of them. Feature parity with Blaze3D is the main goal at the moment, along with getting world rendering working
with Java Edition.
